# DynamicTableWithFixedHeader.
Here I'll create a html project with fixed column with vertical body scrolling.

Some time we need to load thousands of data into our html. At that point, when we scrolling our table header also scrolled and out of the
page and we cann't see it. That time we need to make our html table header fixed but body scrolling.
